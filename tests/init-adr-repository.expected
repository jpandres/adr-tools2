# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 1992-01-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Juan's [adr-tools2](https://github.com/jpandres/adr-tools2).
