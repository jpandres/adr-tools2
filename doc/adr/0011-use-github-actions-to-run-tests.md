# 11. Use github actions to run tests

Date: 2022-07-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The tests were failing, once they got fixed it made sense to have Continous integration.

## Decision

Use github actions to run the tests on every commit and add a badge in the README.md

## Consequences

Users will know if the tool is working or not in every push and will be able to tell also with the badge.
